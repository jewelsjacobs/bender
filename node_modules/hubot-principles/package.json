It's popularity gained enough significance to\nmake to my twitter feed. I use [Campfire][] with my partners to help bridge the\ngap we have while we are off at work. Included is our own [Hubot][] who keeps\nthe chat room fun and unique. I felt such a script would be very useful as\nfrequent reminders we all could use in our pursuit of developing good relations\nwith the people we love.\n\n[@sukima]: https://github.com/sukima/\n[tacit]: http://tacit.livejournal.com/388290.html\n[Campfire]: https://campfirenow.com/\n[Hubot]: http://hubot.github.com/\n",
